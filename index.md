## We Build Brands People Talk About.

We’re a holding company focused on real, cash-flowing businesses with long-term upside. We launch and grow brands people love–and back them with the infrastructure to grow: proven models, experienced operators, and media that moves the needle. Part punk rock, part polished pro.


### Our current portfolio includes:

- **[Lucky Hare](https://luckyhare.com)** - A scratch kitchen + cocktail bar with a strong following and standout food
- **[Night Train Pizza](https://nighttrainpizza.com)** - A brand-forward pizza concept with high margins and franchise potential
- **Pow Media** – Focused content and campaigns to drive growth, build IP, and reduce acquisition costs

We’re now raising our next round to scale what’s working and build what’s next.
