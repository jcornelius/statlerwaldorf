# Invest In A Growing Hospitality Business With Built-In Demand And Expansion Potential

Statler Waldorf is a hospitality-focused holding company operating two high-performing restaurants across from a gated community of 3,000+ affluent homes. In year one, we've generated $1.6 million in top-line revenue. Now, we’re raising $300,000–$500,000 to strengthen our balance sheet, expand operations, and pursue a strategic real estate acquisition that positions us for long-term value creation.

## Highlights

- $1.75MM projected second-year sales
- Limited competition, prime location
- Loyal, high-income customer base
- Operational infrastructure already in place
- Optional real estate acquisition underway
- Strategy includes adding buying real estate and Bitcoin to our balance sheet to strengthen long-term value

## Investment Terms
We offer a fixed, secure return — not speculative equity.

- Annual return: 8% (paid bi-annually)
- Final buyout: 1.5× original investment paid at end of Year 5
- No voting rights
- No ongoing equity after buyback
- Raise structured as a revenue-backed note

This structure provides predictability for investors while giving the founders flexibility to scale, expand into real estate, and reinvest retained earnings into long-term asset strategies like Bitcoin.
